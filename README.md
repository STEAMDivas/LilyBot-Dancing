# LilyBot Dancing
This work instruction guides you through building the project Lily~Bot Dancing through Voice Control. Lily~Bot responds to voice commands, performs a choreographed dance routine to music you upload, can be interrupted with an emergency stop, and uses a sonar sensor for basic obstacle detection.

Features:

Voice Control: Responds to custom voice commands (“Zora”, “Boogie”, “Freeze”, “Ping”, “Check”).
Dancing: Performs a multi-move dance sequence for approx. 2 minutes 53 seconds.
Music Integration: Toggles music module ON/OFF via relay.
Emergency Stop: Stops motors, music, and LEDs instantly.
LED Indicator: Visual cue for dance or obstacles.
Sonar Detection: Adjusts dance for nearby objects.
Music State Reset: Command to re-sync music state.
